# Mechanism of Polymerization of Acrylamide and Bis-Acrylamide Initiated by TEMED and APS

The polymerization of acrylamide and bis-acrylamide using **TEMED (tetramethylethylenediamine)** and **APS (ammonium persulfate)** involves a redox-initiated free radical polymerization reaction. Below is the step-by-step mechanism with formulas.

---

## 1. Initiation of Free Radicals
APS decomposes in the presence of TEMED to generate sulfate radicals (SO₄•⁻). TEMED acts as an accelerator, reducing APS into radicals under mild conditions.

\[
\text{APS} \xrightarrow{\text{TEMED}} 2\text{SO}_4^{•⁻}
\]

The sulfate radicals then initiate the polymerization process by reacting with acrylamide monomers.

---

## 2. Formation of Monomer Radicals
The sulfate radical reacts with acrylamide, forming an acrylamide radical. Acrylamide has the structure:

\[
\text{CH}_2=CHCONH_2
\]

The radical addition mechanism is as follows:

\[
\text{SO}_4^{•⁻} + \text{CH}_2=CHCONH_2 \rightarrow \text{CH}_2^{•}CHCONH_2
\]

---

## 3. Chain Propagation
The acrylamide radical reacts with another acrylamide molecule, continuing the chain propagation. The reaction is:

\[
\text{CH}_2^{•}CHCONH_2 + \text{CH}_2=CHCONH_2 \rightarrow \text{CH}_2CH(CONH_2)\text{CH}_2^{•}CHCONH_2
\]

This process repeats, forming long polymer chains.

## 4. Crosslinking with Bis-Acrylamide
Bis-acrylamide (N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide) serves as the crosslinking agent. Its structure is:

\[
\text{CH}_2=CHCONHCH_2NHCOCH=CH_2
\]

A propagating chain radical can react with a bis-acrylamide molecule, incorporating it into the growing network:

\[
\text{CH}_2^{•}CHCONH_2 + \text{CH}_2=CHCONHCH_2NHCOCH=CH_2 \rightarrow \text{Crosslinked Polymer Chain}
\]

This results in a three-dimensional network of acrylamide and bis-acrylamide.

---

## 5. Termination
Termination occurs when two radicals combine, stopping the chain growth. For example:

\[
\text{CH}_2^{•}CHCONH_2 + \text{CH}_2^{•}CHCONH_2 \rightarrow \text{CH}_2CHCONH_2\text{-CH}_2CHCONH_2
\]

This process can involve combination or disproportionation of radicals.

---

## Overall Reaction
The overall reaction produces a crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel:

\[
\text{n (Acrylamide)} + \text{m (Bis-Acrylamide)} \xrightarrow{\text{APS/TEMED}} \text{Crosslinked Polyacrylamide}
\]

---

## Summary
This mechanism explains how a hydrogel forms from acrylamide and bis-acrylamide using TEMED and APS. TEMED ensures rapid and efficient initiation of the polymerization process.
